“FORMULA 1 MANAGER”  STATISTICS-BASED GAME


I built this web app as a part of university project and I worked with 2 other students. We built it with ASP.NET web forms and we used Oracle database. The database had about 40 tables and the project itself had about 40 .aspx forms (views). We had a basic session management and login system. The idea was that people log in with their account pick a driver and simulate F1 race. There are many factors combined that influence the outcome of a race, like weather conditions, type of tires, driver motivation, experience, concentration etc. My responsibility was everything related to the creation of the database including designing the normalized database schema and writing the SQL queries for creating the database tables.
